# Support-Vector-Machines-model-with-data-analysis
This project, developed by Kishan H S, implements a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to identify pulsar stars from other types of radio-emitting signals. Using the Predicting a Pulsar Star dataset, which I downloaded from the Kaggle website, the aim is to accurately classify whether a candidate signal is a pulsar star or not, based on various measured attributes. SVM was chosen for its strong performance in classification tasks, especially in handling high-dimensional and complex datasets.
